Description: Effect modification occurs if a treatment effect is larger or more stable in certain subgroups defined by observed covariates.  The submax or subgroup-maximum method of Lee et al. (2017) <arXiv:1702.00525> does an overall test and separate tests in subgroups, correcting for multiple testing using the joint distribution.
